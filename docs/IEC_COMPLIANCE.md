# IEC 61131-3 Compliance

STruC++ implements the Structured Text (ST) language from IEC 61131-3. This document lists supported features and known gaps. The compiler also supports common CODESYS extensions where noted.

| REAL, LREAL | Supported | |
| TIME | Supported | Nanosecond precision, int64_t storage |
| DATE | Supported | |
| TIME_OF_DAY | Supported | |
| DATE_AND_TIME | Supported | |
| LTIME, LDATE, LTOD, LDT | Supported | 64-bit time types with nanosecond precision |
| STRING | Supported | Parameterized length: STRING(N), default 254 |
| WSTRING | Supported | Parameterized length: WSTRING(N) |

### Derived Types

| Type | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| TYPE ... END_TYPE | Supported | Type aliases |
| STRUCT ... END_STRUCT | Supported | With nested structs |
| Enumerations | Supported | With optional base type |
| Initialized type declarations | Supported | A type may carry its own default (`Setpoint : REAL := 25.0;`, `Origin : Point := (x := 0.0);`), inherited by every declaration of the type that has no initializer |
| ARRAY (1D) | Supported | Arbitrary bounds: ARRAY[1..10] OF INT |
| ARRAY (2D) | Supported | ARRAY[1..3, 1..4] OF REAL |
| ARRAY (3D) | Supported | ARRAY[1..3, 1..4, 1..5] OF INT |
| ARRAY OF function block | Supported | Declaration, member access, and element invocation (`units[i](step := 1.0)`). A *method* call on an element (`units[0].M()`) is not yet parsed |
| ARRAY[*] (VLA) | Supported | Variable-length array parameters |
| Subranges | Supported | Runtime validation |
| REF_TO | Supported | IEC reference type (explicit dereference) |
| REFERENCE_TO | Supported | CODESYS reference type (implicit dereference) |
| POINTER TO | Supported | CODESYS pointer type with dereference via ^ |

### Not Implemented

| Type | Notes |
|------|-------|
| UNION | CODESYS extension |

## Program Organization Units

| POU | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| PROGRAM | Supported | With CONFIGURATION/RESOURCE/TASK structure |
| FUNCTION | Supported | With return type, all parameter modes |
| FUNCTION_BLOCK | Supported | Instantiation, invocation, member access |
| INTERFACE | Supported | Method and property signatures |

## Variable Declarations

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| VAR | Supported | Local variables |
| VAR_INPUT | Supported | Input parameters |
| VAR_OUTPUT | Supported | Output parameters |
| VAR_IN_OUT | Supported | Pass-by-reference parameters |
| VAR_EXTERNAL | Supported | References either a CONFIGURATION or a file-level VAR_GLOBAL |
| VAR_GLOBAL | Supported | Global variables (CONFIGURATION-scoped or file-level) |
| CONSTANT | Supported | Compile-time constants |
| RETAIN | Supported | Allowed on `VAR`, `VAR_INPUT`, `VAR_OUTPUT` and `VAR_GLOBAL`, per IEC 61131-3. Rejected on `VAR_IN_OUT` / `VAR_TEMP` / `VAR_EXTERNAL`, and inside a `FUNCTION` or `METHOD` (no instance, nothing to retain) |
| PERSISTENT | Partial | Accepted and treated as `RETAIN`. CODESYS also keeps a PERSISTENT value across a program download; that is not implemented, so the weaker shared guarantee is what is claimed |
| NON_RETAIN | Supported | Accepted and treated as the default (a plain `VAR` is already non-retained). Rejected when combined with `RETAIN` or `CONSTANT` |
| AT %IX0.0 | Supported | Located variables (I/Q/M areas, X/B/W/D/L sizes) |
| Multiple names | Supported | `a, b, c : INT := 0;` |
| Initialization | Supported | `:= expression` |
| Array initialization | Supported | `:= [1, 2, 3]` and the bracket-less `:= 1, 2, 3`. Multi-dimensional arrays take either a flat row-major list or a nested one (`:= [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`), where each inner list fills one row from its own bound. Nesting depth and value count are validated against the declared dimensions |
| Array repetition | Supported | `:= [10(0)]`, `:= [3(1), 2(5)]`, `:= [7, 4(2), 9]`. The repeated value may be a structure initializer. Max count 65536 |
| Structure initialization | Supported | `:= (x := 1.0, y := 2.0)`; nested, in array literals, and for FB instances. Omitted elements keep their own declared default. Only valid as a declaration's initial value, as in the standard — one written inside a statement is rejected |
| STRUCT element defaults | Supported | Scalar, array-literal and structure-initializer defaults on a STRUCT element all carry their values |

### Initialization gaps

| Form | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Repetition with no value | `:= [10()]` (ten copies of the element default) — write `:= [10(0)]`, or omit the elements entirely. Matches matiec and CODESYS, which also require a value |

## Standard Functions

All IEC 61131-3 standard functions are implemented in the C++ runtime:

| Category | Functions |
|----------|-----------|
| Numeric | ABS, SQRT, LN, LOG, EXP, EXPT |
| Trigonometric | SIN, COS, TAN, ASIN, ACOS, ATAN, ATAN2 |
| Selection | SEL, MIN, MAX, LIMIT, MUX |
| Comparison | GT, GE, EQ, LE, LT, NE |
| Bitwise | AND, OR, XOR, NOT, MOVE |
| Bit Shift | SHL, SHR, ROL, ROR |
| Type Conversion | *_TO_* (INT_TO_REAL, DINT_TO_STRING, etc.) |
| String | LEN, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, CONCAT, FIND, REPLACE, INSERT, DELETE, UPPER, LOWER, TRIM |
| System | ADR, SIZEOF |

## Standard Function Blocks

Bundled as a compiled `.stlib` library (`libs/iec-standard-fb.stlib`):

| FB | Description |
|----|-------------|
| TON | On-delay timer |
| TOF | Off-delay timer |
| TP | Pulse timer |
| CTU | Count-up counter |
| CTD | Count-down counter |
| CTUD | Up/down counter |
| R_TRIG | Rising edge detector |
| F_TRIG | Falling edge detector |
| SR | Set-dominant bistable |
| RS | Reset-dominant bistable |

Both counting inputs are sampled on the rising edge, as IEC 61131-3 declares them
(`CU : BOOL R_EDGE`, `CD : BOOL R_EDGE`). A count is registered on the scan where
the input goes FALSE to TRUE, for `CD` exactly as for `CU`.

The counting range follows CODESYS rather than the standard's `PVmin`/`PVmax`:
counting up stops at `PV`, which CODESYS documents as the "upper limit for
incrementing", and counting down stops at 0, which it decrements towards "as long
as `CV` is greater than 0". CODESYS reaches that range by typing `CV` and `PV` as
`WORD`, a deviation from IEC that it documents; these blocks keep the IEC types
and express the same range through the `PV` and 0 guards.

`CTUD` keeps the standard's `IF NOT (CU AND CD)` guard, so simultaneous rising
edges on `CU` and `CD` leave `CV` unchanged. CODESYS does not document that case.
